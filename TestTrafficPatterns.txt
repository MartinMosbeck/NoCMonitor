Random => Random dest for every sending
Permuation
        Bit Permutation
                Bit Complement => dest= bit wise complement of src
                Bit Reverse => dest= bit wise reversal of src
                Bit Rotation => dest= rotate bitwise src by 1
                Transpose => a node (i, j) only sends packets to its symmetric
                                node (n − 1 − j, n − 1 −i), n is the size of 
                                the mesh.
                Shuffle => MSB <=> LSB
